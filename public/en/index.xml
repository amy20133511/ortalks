DQ outperforms traditional estimators in bias-variance trade-off, reducing bias and exponentially decreasing variance. Collaborating with ByteDance, DQ achieved a 99% reduction in mean squared error in large-scale commercial scenarios.</description></item><item><title>[OR Talk #22] CityU Lishuai Li &amp; Xinyu He: A Route Network Planning Method for Urban Air Delivery</title><link>http://localhost:1313/en/ortalk/ortalk_22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/en/ortalk/ortalk_22/</guid><description>High-tech companies are investing in drone technologies for urban air delivery to address last-mile delivery issues and reduce road traffic congestion. Effective traffic management is crucial for scaling up these services in dense urban environments. This paper introduces a tube-based ConOps route network planning method, which decouples the NP-hard network planning problem into single-path problems and uses a space cost function for dense route design. Tests show this method generates near-optimal routes with significant computational time savings.</description></item><item><title>[In Talk S5E3] Lenovo: Practical Application of Operations Research in Material Requirement Planning within Lenovo's Supply Chain</title><link>http://localhost:1313/en/intalk/intalk_s5e3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/en/intalk/intalk_s5e3/</guid><description>This lecture will introduce Material Requirement Planning (MRP), explaining its fundamental concepts and significance.
