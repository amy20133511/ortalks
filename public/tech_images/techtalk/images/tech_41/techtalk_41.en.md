summary: "A novel \"Difference-in-Q\" (DQ) estimator, based on reinforcement learning, is proposed to address the Interference problem in A/B testing. DQ outperforms traditional estimators in bias-variance trade-off, reducing bias and exponentially decreasing variance. Collaborating with ByteDance, DQ achieved a 99% reduction in mean squared error in large-scale commercial scenarios."

## Talk Abstract
In the current internet era, A/B testing has become the gold standard for evaluating algorithm performance. However, the issue of interference (the phenomenon where different experimental units affect each other) has consistently posed a significant challenge in A/B testing. This problem undermines the reliability of test results from experimental platforms, despite substantial investments from the industry. To address the interference issue, we propose an innovative solution based on a reinforcement learning framework to reassess A/B testing. This solution estimates the treatment effect by solving for the difference in Q-values in reinforcement learning, hence we name it the "Difference-in-Q" (DQ) estimator. Theoretically, we found that DQ performs exceptionally well in terms of the bias-variance trade-off: it significantly reduces the bias of traditional estimators while achieving exponential reductions in variance compared to any unbiased estimator. In collaboration with Douyin, we applied DQ to large-scale commercial scenarios, where preliminary tests showed a reduction in mean squared error by over 99%. Additionally, DQ demonstrated outstanding performance in a commercial-grade car-sharing simulator. In this presentation, I will introduce the theory and practice of DQ, and discuss the design and prospects of the next generation of intelligent experimental platforms.

## Q&A
Can A/B testing be extended to scenarios with multiple groups like A/B/C/D?
: Yes, it can. The methodology is highly scalable, but it requires modifications to the corresponding mathematical descriptions.


In A/A testing, does the two A’s refer to comparisons between different versions?
: No, A/A testing refers to split testing of the same algorithm. In this case, the true treatment effect is 0. It is generally used to check the robustness of the estimator or to estimate the variance of the estimator. A/A testing can divide users into two groups for testing, and sometimes it is also conducted across two different time periods.


What is the inspiration/intuition behind the DQ method?
: From the perspective of reinforcement learning (RL), interference mainly arises because the current action affects future rewards. Therefore, our method to eliminate interference uses the sum of future rewards (i.e., Q-value) instead of the current reward to calculate the difference between the two experimental groups. We provided two examples in the Douyin scenario to further explain this, and for more details, you are welcome to watch the video or read the paper.
